## Description
This is a ReactJS based personal resume website. This web application entails my basic information, description about me, my past projects & work experiences, skill I have acquired and some of my developed applications.<br/> 
The website is currently deployed on gh-pages at <a href = "https://pranav2308.github.io/portfoliopranav/">here</a>. <br/>
